# Contacts-app
-> We have used one reducers(contactReducer.js), in that array contains our input elements as objects.
-> index.js file is having the root element. We are using app as a custom component here.
-> Navbar/index.js contains the header. Whenever we click on the contacts app in the header, it will go to the main/home page.
-> Home/index.js contains the table structure and deletion logic.
-> AddContact/index.js contains the add contacts page structure and contacts addition logic.Few validation are performed for adding the contacts.
    * We can't provide the already existing email Id and phone number used in the contacts table. 
      If we use the existing email Id or phone number we will receive a popup message "This email already exists!!" and "This phone number already exists!!". 
    * All fields are mandatory. We will receive a popup message "Please fill in all fields!!", if the user missed to fill any   fields.
-> EditContact/index.js contains the contacts editing logic.
-> As we are using our own data (not from database), whenever we refresh the page it will go to its original state.


# create react app general information
# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
